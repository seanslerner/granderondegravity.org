    title: "Who We Are"
    excerpt: '<br>We are a group of local riders and trail builders who want to expand opportunities for downhill mountain biking in Eastern Oregon. We are committed to being good stewards of the land, building well-made and sustainable trails. More importantly, we are dedicated to creating a welcoming and supportive community around our work.'

    title: "What Sets Us Apart"
    excerpt: '<br>Central to Grande Ronde Gravity’s mission is the idea of belonging. To put it simply: mountain biking has an exclusivity problem. There are well-known economic and social barriers to engaging with the sport. GRG hopes to lower some of these barriers through programs that particularly encourage women and young people to get on bikes and ride local trails. Through grants and donations, we are able to provide interested youth with quality, reliable mountain bikes at little to no cost. Similar programs for adults ensure they are on bikes that are suited for the terrain, well-made, and safe. GRG also cultivates belonging through group rides, instructional sessions, races, and numerous shuttle days, which are free for people to join. We hope these activities will foster both camaraderie and a joy for the sport in new and experienced riders.'

    title: "Why We Exist"
    excerpt: '<br>We exist because we see room for the growth of mountain biking in our region, and we want to develop a supportive and welcoming culture around riding. We believe this happens when riders are connected to the trails they use. Our programming engages volunteers in trail building and then links that work to a wide array of social events around riding.'

    title: "What We Do and How We Do It"
    excerpt: '<br>We literally start from the ground up, organizing volunteers to build and maintain trails in the local mountains. Participants learn how to build a berm, what’s involved in shaping a good jump, ways to think about lines and turns, and how to imagine a trail into existence. All this work builds community and connects people intimately with the dirt they ride on in ways most riders tend to miss. Work days are complemented by shuttle days, group rides, and races that take place where volunteers work. There is a deep joy in riding a portion of trail you have built, and the connections fostered between volunteers — through riding and digging — is brilliant.'

    title: "Who We're Here For"
    excerpt: '<br>We are here for women who want to send it without worrying about ego and pressure to ride beyond their comfort.<br><br>We are here for people who want to improve their skills on the bike without having to project “bro” energy. <br><br>We are here for kids who ride 50 laps around the block on the sidewalk but dream of a dirt jump somewhere up on the mountain.<br><br>We are here for anyone who wants to ride a newly built berm and howl.<br><br>We are here for people who like to move dirt and think about the physics of a jump line.<br><br>We are here for people who have not felt like they belong in so many other spaces.<br><br><b>We are here to support one another, in the beautiful outdoors, riding downhill.</b>'
