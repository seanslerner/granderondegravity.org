    title: "Support Dirt Jumps in La Grande"
    excerpt: '<br>Jumping is one of the most fun things you can do on a bmx or mountain bike, but, like any technical skill, to do it well and safely takes regular practice on well built jumps.<br><br>The recently opened Pioneer Park Pump Track gives beginner riders the chance to try jumping their bike...'

    title: "What are dirt jumps / BMX trails?"
    excerpt: '<br>A dirt jump park is a dedicated area where cyclists can ride their bikes over specially designed jumps made of dirt, allowing them to practice aerial tricks and maneuvers, often with varying difficulty levels to cater to different skill levels. It is similar to a BMX track but with larger jumps focused on performing tricks in the air. Essentially, it is a place to practice "dirt jumping" on a variety of jumps.'

    title: "Why La Grande needs a jump park"
    excerpt: '<br>La Grande currently has the only pump track in eastern Oregon. Even better is that it’s co-located with the skate park. The draw of the pump track is already apparent, as cyclists coming through town stop to burn some energy riding the track.<br><br>A dirt jump park would elevate La Grande’s profile exponentially, drawing in riders from Idaho, western Oregon, and Washington. Mountain bikers looking to build skills before using MERA or Anthony Lakes will stop specifically to practice on a dirt jump line. And locals who are developing skills to use on either a mountain bike or a bmx bike will find the different levels of dirt jumps to be integral to improvement.'
