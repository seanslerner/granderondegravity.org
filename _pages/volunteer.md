    excerpt: '<br>Almost every Wednesday and Saturday afternoon from 3:30 to 6:00 or so, assuming good weather, we bring our library of BMX bikes down to Pioneer Park so that anyone can ride the pump track and skate park. The seven bikes were purchased in fall of 2024 with the generous support of the Wildhorse Foundation. In spring of 2025 we will be adding an additional 4 bikes with the support of Travel Oregon.<br><br>If you would like to help out with the library, email us at <a href="mailto=info@granderondegravity.org">info@granderondegravity.org</a>.'
